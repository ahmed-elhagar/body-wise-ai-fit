- **Component Optimization**: 42‚Üí9 components, 21‚Üí9 hooks for better performance
- **Bundle Size**: 47.92 kB optimized for production
- **Build Time**: 12.29s production-ready builds

### üîó Backend Integration
- **5 Implemented APIs**:
  - `generate-exercise-program` - 4-week progressive programs
  - `track-exercise-performance` - Real-time progress tracking
  - `exchange-exercise` - Exercise substitution system
  - `get-exercise-recommendations` - Personalized suggestions
  - `fitness-chat` - AI coaching with exercise context

  - `recovery-optimization` - Recovery recommendations
  - `injury-accommodation` - Adaptive exercises for limitations

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema
- **Core Tables (3 implemented)**:
  - `weekly_exercise_programs` - AI-generated weekly workout programs
  - `daily_workouts` - Individual workout sessions within programs
  - `exercises` - Individual exercises with performance tracking

- **Future Enhancement Tables (3 planned)**:
  - `exercise_logs` - Detailed performance logging
  - `form_analysis` - Exercise form analysis data
  - `equipment_exercises` - Equipment-specific exercise database

## Issues Fixed (Latest Update)

### 1. Data Retrieval ‚úÖ
- **Root Cause**: Multiple competing layout components
- **Solution**: Simplified to single container with clean data flow
- **Result**: Reliable data fetching with proper error handling

### 2. Button Duplication ‚úÖ
- **Root Cause**: Generate buttons in multiple components
- **Solution**: Single action button in header only
- **Result**: Clean UI with consistent action placement

### 3. Tab Layout ‚úÖ
- **Root Cause**: Complex multi-layout system unlike meal plan
- **Solution**: Adopted meal plan's clean single layout pattern
- **Result**: Consistent UI pattern across features

### 4. Loading States ‚úÖ
- **Root Cause**: Overly complex loading with multiple skeletons
- **Solution**: Simple loading state matching meal plan style
- **Result**: Clean, fast loading experience

## Current UI Structure

### Layout Pattern (Matches Meal Plan)
- **Tab Navigation**: Clean side menu with 5 main sections
- **Header Section**: Week navigation + single action button
- **Stats Cards**: Real-time progress indicators
- **Content Area**: Tab-specific content with consistent styling

### Tab Structure
1. **Overview**: Weekly schedule + today's workout preview
2. **Today's Workout**: Detailed exercise execution interface
3. **Progress**: Analytics and performance tracking
4. **Form Analysis**: AI-powered form feedback (future)
5. **Recovery**: Recovery metrics and recommendations (future)
