# Approved Profile Implementation

This folder contains the ONLY approved profile design implementation for FitGenius.

## Structure
```
approved/
├── ProfilePage.tsx              # Main profile page component
├── RefactoredProfileView.tsx    # Layout wrapper for profile cards
└── enhanced/
    ├── ProfileBasicInfoCard.tsx # Personal information card
    ├── ProfileGoalsCard.tsx     # Fitness goals and preferences card
    └── ProfileHealthCard.tsx    # Health information card (shared)
```

## Design Principles
- Single page layout (NO TABS)
- Card-based design with edit-in-place functionality
- Clean, modern UI with gradient backgrounds
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Individual save buttons for each section

## Usage
The profile page is accessed via `/profile` route and renders:
1. Header with progress indicator and completion badge
2. Three main cards: Basic Info, Goals, and Health
3. Each card has edit/view modes with save/cancel actions

## DO NOT MODIFY
This is the approved design. Any changes must be approved before implementation.
Any old profile components should be archived, not used.
