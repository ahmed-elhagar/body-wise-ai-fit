6. Success notification and dashboard refresh

### Progress Update Flow
1. User updates goal progress (manual or automatic)
2. Current value updated in database
3. Progress percentage recalculated
4. Milestone completion checked
5. Achievement detection triggered
6. UI components update with new progress
7. Notifications sent if milestones reached

### Goal Completion Flow
1. Goal marked as completed (manual or automatic)
2. Completion timestamp recorded
3. Achievement notification triggered
4. Goal moved to completed section
5. Statistics updated across dashboard
6. Celebration animation/notification shown
