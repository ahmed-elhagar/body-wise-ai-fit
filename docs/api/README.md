## üîê Authentication

All API requests require authentication via Supabase Auth:

```javascript
const headers = {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${session.access_token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'apikey': 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inhub3NsZmZ0Zmt0cXZ5b2VmY2N3Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDgzNjgyMjksImV4cCI6MjA2Mzk0NDIyOX0.CdNxnsKk7HhLE2lhROsx6IlVn5hP94yH3XZfJoHDakQ'
}
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Set up Supabase client**:
```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabase = createClient(
  'https://xnoslfftfktqvyoefccw.supabase.co',
  'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Inhub3NsZmZ0Zmt0cXZ5b2VmY2N3Iiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NDgzNjgyMjksImV4cCI6MjA2Mzk0NDIyOX0.CdNxnsKk7HhLE2lhROsx6IlVn5hP94yH3XZfJoHDakQ'
);
```

2. **Make authenticated requests**:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('id', user.id);
```

3. **Call Edge Functions**:
```javascript
const { data, error } = await supabase.functions.invoke('generate-meal-plan', {
  body: { userData, preferences }
});
```
