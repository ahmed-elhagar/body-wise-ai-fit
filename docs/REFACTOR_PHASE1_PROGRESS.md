# Refactoring Progress - Phase 1

## âœ… Completed
- Created feature-based folder structure foundation
- Defined types for all major features
- Created utility functions for meal-plan and exercise features
- Set up clean export patterns via index.ts files
- Identified unused components for removal

## ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Mapping all components to their respective features
- Identifying unused imports across the codebase

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps (Phase 2)

### Feature Consolidation Plan:

#### 1. Meal Plan Feature (`/features/meal-plan/`)
**Move these components:**
- All `/components/meal-plan/*` â†’ `/features/meal-plan/components/`
- All meal plan hooks â†’ `/features/meal-plan/hooks/`
- Update imports in: `src/pages/MealPlan.tsx`

#### 2. Exercise Feature (`/features/exercise/`)
**Move these components:**
- All `/components/exercise/*` â†’ `/features/exercise/components/`
- `useOptimizedExercise*.ts` hooks â†’ `/features/exercise/hooks/`
- Update imports in: `src/pages/Exercise.tsx`

#### 3. Profile Feature (`/features/profile/`)
**Move these components:**
- All `/components/profile/*` â†’ `/features/profile/components/`
- All `/components/settings/*` â†’ `/features/profile/components/settings/`
- Update imports in: `src/pages/Profile.tsx`, `src/pages/Settings.tsx`

#### 4. Dashboard Feature (`/features/dashboard/`)
**Move these components:**
- All `/components/dashboard/*` â†’ `/features/dashboard/components/`
- All `/components/dashboard-stats/*` â†’ `/features/dashboard/components/stats/`
- Update imports in: `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

### Cleanup Targets:
- [x] Remove `src/components/DebugPanel.tsx`
- [ ] Remove `src/components/SubscriptionDebugPanel.tsx`
- [ ] Remove `src/utils/seedBasicFoods.ts`
- [ ] Clean up unused imports across all files
- [ ] Consolidate duplicate components

### Import Path Updates Needed:
- Update all pages to import from feature modules
- Update component cross-references
- Update hook imports
- Update type imports

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Zero functionality changes
- Clean, maintainable file structure
- Easy feature browsing
- Reduced bundle size through tree-shaking
- Clear separation of concerns
